Simulation code for estimating Volumetric Rates of Super-Luminous Supernovae (SLSNe) using data from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The code is built over the Simulation tool [simsurvey](https://github.com/ZwickyTransientFacility/simsurvey) developed by Ulrich Feindt (see Documentation [here](https://simsurvey.readthedocs.io/) and Paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03923)).

The code is still under development.
